# AR-Map
ARKit implementations that pins users locations to maps and globes. One implimentation takes user addresses in string format and pins those addresses, using augmented reality pins, to a real world map. These pins keep their position regardless of the angle or position of the phone. The other implimentation places an augmented reality globe in front of the user where a similar pins related to a user's address can be placed.
